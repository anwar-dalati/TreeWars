Tree Wars - Quick Game Instructions

Objective: 
Let your tree grow and prosper. Kill the opposition by denying them access to vital Sun and Water.

Gameplay: 
Your tree takes Water from the ground through its root system and light from the Sun through its leaves. From this it generates Nutrients.
Nutrients are used to grow your tree and improve various aspects:

Tree Actions
Grow in Height - Increases the height of your tree. Higher trees can overshadow smaller trees but need more light and water to survive.
Grow in Width - Increases the Width of your tree. Wider trees take in more light but also need more light and water to survive. This action reduces your Foilage Density.
Increase Foilage Density - Grow more leaves! More leaves mean more light! But they also need more water.
Spread Roots - Grow roots in the ground to increase your water intake.
Increase Root Density - Denser roots are more efficient at taking water from the ground.
Increase Root Strength - Stronger roots are immune to attacks by lesser roots.

Weather Actions
Call Sunshine - The sun shines more brightly for 10 seconds, increasing everyone's light intake. Sunshine is cancelled by rain.
Call Rain - A refreshing shower of rain increases the grounds humidity level. Rain is cancelled by sunshine.
Call Spring - All trees undergo a growth spurt as their nutrient generation rate is doubled!

Hazards
Every once in a while you get a Hazard Point. Use them to unleash terrible horrors on all trees:
Cold Snap - A sudden snap of cold reduces foilage density and ends spring.
Drought - A drought reduces ground humidity and eats into all trees' Water reserves.
Storm - Whip up a terrible storm to break off treetops or even uproot entire trees!
